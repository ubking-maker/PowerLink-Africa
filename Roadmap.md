This roadmap outlines PowerLink Africa’s step-by-step plan for development, testing, and expansion. 

The focus is to start lean with a mobile-first MVP, gather user feedback, and scale into a full decentralized infrastructure network serving communities across Africa.





Phase 1: Research and MVP Design (Q4 2025)


Conduct deep research on energy and connectivity challenges across key African regions.


Design the mobile-first MVP architecture using Base Blockchain for coordination and transparency.


Set up the GitHub repository, documentation, and visual architecture diagram.


Begin early outreach to community partners and local testers.




Phase 2: MVP Development and Prototype Release (Q1 2026)


Develop the initial mobile application (React Native).


Integrate Base Blockchain smart contracts for transaction recording and community funding.


Implement wallet connection and user registration.
